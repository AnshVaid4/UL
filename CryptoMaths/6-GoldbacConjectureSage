'''
Goldbachâ€™s conjecture states that every even integer
 N=2k 4 can be written as the sum of two primes. In
 mathematical terms, for every k=2 , we can find
 primes pk, qk such that
 2k=pk+qk
 There is no proof of this conjecture yet, but it is verified for
 very large integers, upto 4 x 10^18.The first even numbers
 are
 4=2+2
 6=3+3
 8=3+5
 Write a Sage programme which verifies this conjecture for
 the first 50 even integers, that is, for N=2k, where
 k=1... 50.
