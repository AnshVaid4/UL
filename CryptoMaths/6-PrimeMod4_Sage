'''
 Primes are either congruent 1, 2, or 3 modulo 4. In this
 Problem, we extend Euklid’s Lemma (which states that
 there are infinitely many primes) to primes congruent
 three modulo four.
 a) List all primes congruent 2 modulo 4. Provide the first five
 primes that are congruent 1 modulo 4. Similarly, provide
 the first five primes that are congruent 3 modulo 4.
 b) If a 3mod4andb 3mod4,thenab ?mod4. Findthe
 residue ?.
 c) Show, by using induction, if each of an even number of
 primes q1 x q2 x q2k is congruent 3 mod 4, then the product
 q1 x q2 x q2k-1 x q2k cong 1mod4
 d) Finally, use the indirect argument of Euklid’s Lemma, to
 show that there are infinitely many primes congruent 3
 modulo four, by considering the product
 p1 x p2 x pn +1
 Hint: Group factors into primes 12 and 3, and then
 applying (a) and (b)
